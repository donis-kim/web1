<h2>CSS 란 무엇인가?</h2>

<p>
  Cascading Style Sheets , or Cascading Style Sheets ( Cascading Style Sheets , CSS)
  is a markup language, a language that describes how the actual display [1] ,
  HTML and XHTML mainly used in, XML can be used in.
  It is a W3C standard and has a high degree of freedom in defining layout and style.
  If the markup language (ex. HTML) is responsible for the body of the website,
  CSS can be said to serve as a decoration for clothes and accessories.
  In other words, you can decorate it like any other website by changing
  the CSS file without changing the HTML structure.
  In the case of CSS3, which is currently under development ,
  the ability to replace images produced by graphic editing programs
  such as shadow effects, gradients, and transformations has been added.
  Also, various animation functions have been added to replace
  Adobe Flash to some extent.
